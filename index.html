        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! Nice to meet you. I'd like to tell you a story about myself.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Not that many know this about me, but I started at community college as a Mechanical Engineering major where I figured that I enjoyed mathamatical modeling. I did fine at my time there, but I wasn't truly curious
            about my work. That changed when I transfered to UC Davis and took my first every statistics class. I was instantly curious and perhaps asked too many questions in class. But, my very kind professor encouraged me to ask more questions and explore further on my own time. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            He showed me that deeper knowledge of statistics (and math) 
            was something worth pursuing. After the quarter, we met for coffee and he walked me through what he does as a Data Scientist. This first interaction at my transition to UC Davis was deeply impactful for me. Dr. Bissell,
            you are reading this, thank you.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Now, I currently work as a Data Scientist at Davis Sensory Institute. There, I built a nice ML algorithm to uncover latent market structures from liking data. I'm also a senior at UC Davis,
            studying Statistics & Data Science with a minor in math. I'm broadly interested in Causal Inference, ML theory, ML cloud infrastructure and math. 
            Nowadays in my free time, I'm studying analysis, DSA, and ML theory.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working or studying, you can find me in Japan, playing soccer, or eating ice cream.
        </p>

                <span class="title">Mapping Economic Bias in the NBA</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                <strong>The Problem:</strong> It is often the case that econometric analyses often conclude with a wall of coefficients, a static list that confirms bias exists. 
                This is technically correct, but it fails to reveal the underlying bias structure and how each player fits into that structure. 
                Furthermore, applying standard models to the NBA leads to severe misspecification because deterministic contracts (Rookie Scale, Max Contract) distort free-market signals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong> I developed a Stratified Double Machine Learning framework. By strictly isolating free-market players to learn the true "price" of bias, 
                I could counterfactually apply these valuations to the full league. I then fed these attributions into my own probabilistic dimension reduction model to interactively visualize the 
                geometric topology of market inefficiency. Practically, this means we can visualize exactly how and where the NBA market systematically misprices players, not just that bias exists. 
                On a side, my models suggest that Lebron James's compensation is strongly upward biased because of his seniority, accounting for performance.

                <span class="title">End-to-End Flight Forecasting System</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                <strong>The Problem:</strong> If you search online, you will not find many historical flight listings. You also will not find any many usful predictive tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong> I architected a complete cloud-native system on AWS. I built the fully serverless ETL pipeline using Dockerized Lambda to automate data 
                collection and construct a data lake in S3. Then, I developed a "Dual-Model" architecture: 
                a regression model for market-level forecasting and a classification model to generate tactical "Buy/Wait" signals for individual flights.

            <p>
                <strong>The Problem:</strong> Being honest, I didn't really have a problem I wanted to solve going in. I was just always curious about the phrase "Correlation does not imply Causation". 
                I always wondered "Ok, but what <em>can</em> we say about causality, if at all?" This project were the highlights of exploring that question. I used <em>Elements of Causal Inference</em> by Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, 
                and Bernhard Schölkopf as my textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong> I built a interactive web application to simulate the PC Algorithm from scratch. It allows users to visualize how conditional independence 
                testing can be used to recover causal graphs from observational data, demonstrating both the limitations and power of causal discovery.

            </div>
            
            <p>
                <strong>The Problem:</strong> I'm a big fan of burpees. However, sometimes I find myself losing count of my reps because I'm focusing on my breathing or technique. Therefore, I wondered if
                I could have the computer count for me! 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong> I implemented a Pose Estimation system using MediaPipe. It is a finite state machine based on the geometry of body landmarks. This allowed the system to logically
                group complex movement sequences into accurate, full-range-of-motion counts.
